# AdventOf-Code-2020

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I just heard about the existing of this website. Whenever I have a time, I solve the puzzles, I recommend everyone to try them.
